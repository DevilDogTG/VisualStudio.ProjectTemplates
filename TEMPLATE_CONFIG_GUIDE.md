# Template Configuration Guide

The full configuration walkthrough now lives in the consolidated [README](./README.md#template-configuration).

Use this file as a quick pointer when browsing the repository structure:

1. Update the `template.config.json` of the template you want to export.
2. Consult the README for property descriptions, tag recommendations, and sample manifests.
3. Run `./scripts/Export-DmnsnTemplate.ps1` to regenerate the `.vstemplate` and ZIP package.

Keeping a single source of truth helps us avoid driftâ€”open a discussion if you spot anything missing from the README.
